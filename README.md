# AndroidCarPoolRider

AndroidCarPoolRider is an android app for a person who wishes to get picked up by drivers in their vehicles heading to another location. The benefit for the riders is that it is a cheaper way to travel, as cost is calculated by the km driven with the current gas price. Riders can create tickets when they want to travel and they provide details such as locations, destination, time number of seats, date and time for the driver to be able to filter out potential riders heading in the same direction.
